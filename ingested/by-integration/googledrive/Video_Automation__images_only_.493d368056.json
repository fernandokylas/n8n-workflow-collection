I want your help in generating historical POV videos, in which the user sees POV-style images of an individual throughout a major breakthrough in science in technology. The channel's name is \"Before it Changed Everything.\"\n\nEach video is 25 seconds long, and contains 5 scenes, 5 seconds each.\n\nEach scene requires one image and one audio voiceover, so the whole story will consist of 5 images and 5 audios. !important\n\nThe entire 25 second video would narrate a short story from that historical era.\n\nThe image prompts have to be such that they help the AI model maintain as much consistency from one image to the next. Since it's a POV video, there are very few details of the person itself that must be maintained aside from arms and feet, and torso and legs if visible.\n\nevery scene should have the POV individual interacting with a new character or setting, so this would also reduce the need for consistency aside from the same historical time period. However, remember to describe each scene with enough references so that each prompt can work individually.\n\nAny visible details of the character (hands feet accessories) must also be referenced in each prompt and described in way that maintains consistency.\n\nFor example, if you're describing the battle of Marathon and your first prompt is about an athenian hoplite surrounded by soldiers\n\nthe next image prompt must also specify that the soldiers are athenian from the battle of marathon\n\nFinally, the script should be such as to give enough details about the event, but not give the actual topic away. The script should always end as - can you guess the discovery - this would be part of the 5th segment, not an addional one\n\nHere are three ideal outputs\n\nScene 1 \u2013 Setting the Type\n\nPOV of a young male apprentice working in Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing workshop during the creation of the Gutenberg Bible (circa 1454).\nLocation: Mainz, Germany. Time Period: Mid-15th century. Setting: A medieval print shop at dawn, with timber beams, stone walls, and floors stained with ink. The space is lit dimly by hanging tallow candles and an early morning glow through a small window.\nVisible Body Parts: Your light-skinned hands are ink-stained and youthful, gripping a wooden composing stick filled with reversed cast-metal movable type. You\u2019re wearing a cream-colored linen shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbow and a leather apron over the front. Black ink is smudged along your knuckles and fingers.\nObjects in Scene: Brass typesetting tools, loose metal letter blocks, parchment scraps, candle stubs, wooden tables and shelving lined with ink pots, scrolls, and stacked paper.\nPeople in Scene: Johannes Gutenberg, a bearded middle-aged man in a dark wool robe, stands beside two young apprentices in plain tunics, one with a leather cap. They are discussing a typeset frame.\nAtmosphere: The air smells of wax, metal, and damp parchment. The environment is quiet but intense \u2014 the only sounds are soft footsteps, the creak of wood, and the delicate click of metal type.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cMaster Gutenberg said today would change the world. I still don\u2019t know how, but I believe him.\u201d\n\n\u2e3b\n\nScene 2 \u2013 Assembling the Page\n\nPOV of a young male apprentice working in Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing workshop during the creation of the Gutenberg Bible (circa 1454).\nLocation: Mainz, Germany. Time Period: Mid-15th century. Setting: The composing room of a medieval print shop during mid-morning. Wooden beams stretch across the ceiling. Light streams in from a narrow window, illuminating workbenches and shelves filled with parchment and metal type.\nVisible Body Parts: Your fair-skinned fingers, stained with black ink and gray lead dust, are delicately arranging tiny reversed metal letters into a composing tray. You wear a loose-fitting white linen shirt with the sleeves pushed up to the elbows. A brown leather apron is partially visible.\nObjects in Scene: A composing stick and tray, several piles of lead type, an open parchment sample of Latin text, ink cloth, wooden drawers filled with type blocks, and brass tweezers.\nPeople in Scene: A young boy in a brown woolen cap leans nearby, watching your work. Another apprentice with curly hair sorts letters into compartments in the background.\nAtmosphere: The room is quiet and focused. Dust floats in the sunlight. The air smells of wax, metal, and ink.\nImage to video: your hands are gently moving across the composing tray\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cEach letter must be perfect. Backwards, precise, eternal.

Time Period: Mid-15th century. Setting: A candlelit central chamber within a medieval print shop, dominated by a large oak screw press. Afternoon light spills through a small window, mixing with flickering candlelight.\nVisible Body Parts: Your hands grip a large wooden press lever, forearms straining under effort. Your rolled-up linen sleeves reveal ink-smudged skin. The tops of your worn leather shoes are barely visible below.\nObjects in Scene: A heavy wooden screw press, a parchment page secured under the press plate, a nearby ink roller covered in thick black ink, rags for cleaning, an oil pot, and drying parchment stacked neatly nearby.\nPeople in Scene: Johannes Gutenberg stands behind the press with folded arms, observing closely. Another apprentice loads a new forme with type in the background.\nAtmosphere: The press groans under pressure. The room smells of ink, oil, and scorched parchment. The moment is tense, mechanical, and filled with focus.\nimage to video: you pull down on the lever\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe press it down \u2014 firm, not forceful.
